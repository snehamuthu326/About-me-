👋 Hi, I’m @snehamuthu326

👀 I’m interested in coding, technology, and exploring new tools for software development. I’m not only passionate about coding but also enjoy keeping up with music, sports, and the latest trends. I believe that a well-rounded perspective helps me stay inspired and creative in all my projects.

🌱 I’m currently learning backend development with tools and frameworks like Node.js and Django to build robust and scalable applications. I’m also improving my skills in Flutter by learning various widgets and tools for cross-platform development, and I’m diving into UI/UX design to add a creative edge to my technical projects.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, innovative application ideas, and any tech-related projects that provide hands-on learning opportunities and problem-solving challenges.
